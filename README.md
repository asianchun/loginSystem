## Customisation

Feel free to customize the Login System to suit your preferences. Here are a few ideas:

- Additional User Details: Extend the user profile with additional information.
- Password Recovery: Implement a password recovery mechanism.
- UI/UX Improvements: Enhance the visual aspects of the application for a better user experience.
- Security Improvements: Make the passwords hashed and store it in an actual database.
